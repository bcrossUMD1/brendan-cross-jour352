  <p>BOSTON — At shootaround before Game 3 of the second round, Jaylen Brown shrugged off a question about the Boston Celtics’ playoff struggles at home. They had dropped Game 2 at TD Garden for the second straight series, but Brown would not accept that they had a problem. In the past, sure, Boston had trouble protecting the parquet. Brown said the Celtics were focused on changing that narrative.</p>
  <p>The answer continued a pattern for him. When asked about previous seasons, he often chose to dismiss the connection to this version of the team. He didn’t fully explain why until the Celtics, after giving up almost all of a 21-point fourth-quarter lead in Game 3 of the NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks, regrouped to salvage a 106-99 win.</p>
  <p>“All year long, we’ve been hearing about the Celtics of the past,” Brown said. “For the last six to eight months, that’s all we’ve been hearing is all the different shortcomings we’ve had in the past. This is a new team, you know what I mean. We’ve learned from those experiences. And in these moments, you can see that we learned from it.”</p>

  <p>After Brown’s comment about his team’s performance in Boston, the Celtics completed the playoffs with seven straight wins at TD Garden, including Monday night’s Game 5 victory to earn them their first NBA championship since 2008. They only dropped one game on the road during that time while finishing the postseason with 11 wins in their final 12 games. As Brown said, they weren’t the same team. Years of heartache had molded them. A series of sharp roster moves had fortified them. Joe Mazzulla, with more time and experience as a young coach, had reshaped them.</p>
  
  <p>“All of our adversity has made us stronger, made us tougher,” Brown said after closing out the NBA Finals with a 106-88 win. “All season you could see it. We started from the jump. We made all the sacrifices. We played both ends of the ball at a high level. We didn’t skip any steps. And this was the result.”

  <p class="chapter-headline">Building A Champion</p>

  <p>When Brad Stevens replaced Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations in June 2021, Boston’s roster-building strategy evolved. Ainge had been holding tight to draft picks for years as he weighed whether to trade Tatum or Brown for a veteran star. While the team tried to put the right veterans in place, injuries to Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker made them come up just short. But by the time Stevens moved from head coach into the front office, the Jays were on their way to becoming franchise cornerstones and there was an opportunity to rebuild the supporting cast.
</p>
  <p>“I don’t actually think there was a big shift in philosophy in the types of players we were trying to acquire,” assistant GM Mike Zarren told <i>The Athletic</i>. “I think it was just a combination of it was really obvious it was time to shove more chips in, but more just some trades became available for players we always liked and we went and got them.”</p>

<p>Within weeks of his hiring, Stevens traded for Al Horford in what was widely viewed at the time to be a cost-saving move. He unloaded the injured Walker’s contract on the Oklahoma City Thunder, along with a first-round pick that ended up being promising Rockets big Alperen Şengün. Even though the pick materialized into a good player, Stevens maintained that the Celtics wanted to revive Horford’s career after it hit a lull following his initial departure from Boston.</p>

<p>While many believed Horford was on the verge of retirement, Stevens was right. Horford was rejuvenated in Boston, becoming the team’s starting center. The success of the Horford deal exemplified how targeting undervalued players who would embrace a supporting role could allow the Celtics to build a deep roster to complement Tatum and Brown.</p>

<p>That led to the Derrick White deal in February 2022, which included a risky top-1 protected pick swap heading to San Antonio in 2028. But the Celtics front office believed White was one of the most impactful players in the NBA and he was another personality who could seamlessly fit into the locker room.</p>

<p>“Danny and I talked about drafting Derrick. San Antonio just got to him before we did,” Zarren said. “From his second year until the time of the trade, we had inquired about him every single year. Their price was always just higher than we were willing to pay until the deal came along that we did.”</p>

<p>This season, he emerged as a near-All-Star, made the All-Defensive second team alongside Jrue Holiday and became one of the Celtics’ most relied-upon clutch shooters. It became apparent the front office wanted to build a locker room full of players who enjoyed fitting into their roles.</p>

<p>“Brad Stevens tries to get great players, but also great individuals as people,” Celtics governor Steve Pagliuca said. “And it paid off for us here.”</p>

<p>Horford, White and Holiday have a reputation for embracing sacrifice for the group. Even Kristaps Porziņģis was acquired at a point in his career where he had been humbled and wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself.</p>

<p>“I told (Brown and Tatum) from Day 1, I’m coming in here to help you guys win,” Porziņģis, acquired in June 2023, told The Athletic before the finals. “That’s all I’m here for and whatever it takes. If it takes me sitting on the bench or coming off the bench or whatever, then I’m here for it.”</p>

<p>While Stevens was able to execute the trades the Ainge front office was unable to, trading Marcus Smart for Porziņģis. That deal came with a tremendous emotional cost and chemistry risk.</p>

<p>“It was a really difficult trade because trading Marcus wasn’t easy,” Zarren said. “But Kristaps added a dimension to the team that we just didn’t have.”</p>

<p>When Holiday was sent to Portland for Damian Lillard on Sept. 27, the Celtics called the Blazers to negotiate an offer that same day. They started talking on a Wednesday and the deal was announced by Sunday.</p>

<p>The surprise Holiday trade just before the start of this season’s training camp made the team complete on the court, but Boston also ensured every person surrounding Tatum and Brown had the personality to buy in. The front office was deliberate in the characters it brought into the group, often passing on bigger names to prioritize two-way versatility and spacing.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of their career, we were more focused on high-usage playmaking points guards,” Celtics director of player personnel Austin Ainge said. “We’ve shifted now as they’ve matured in their games as on-ball creators to guys that can play off the ball and defend like Derrick (White) and Jrue (Holiday).”</p>
